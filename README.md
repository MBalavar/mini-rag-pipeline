# Dockerized RAG Pipeline


## 📖 Introduction

The Dockerized RAG Pipeline is a Retrieve and Generate (RAG) pipeline designed for efficient document processing and query handling. This pipeline leverages ChromaDB for embedding storage and retrieval and uses the “t5-small” model to synthesise the final response as the generator. Dockerization ensures consistent environments across development and production, simplifying deployment and scaling.

## 🚀 Features

- Document Processing: Efficiently process and store documents in `.docx` format.
- Embedding Storage: Utilise ChromaDB for scalable and fast embedding storage.
- Dockerized Setup: Simplify deployment with Docker, ensuring consistency across environments.
- Generator Model: Leveraging "t5-small" model for synthesising the final response.
