## üìñ Introduction

The Dockerized RAG Pipeline is a Retrieve and Generate (RAG) pipeline designed for efficient document processing and query handling. This pipeline leverages ChromaDB for embedding storage and retrieval and uses the ‚Äút5-small‚Äù model to synthesise the final response as the generator. Dockerization ensures consistent environments across development and production, simplifying deployment and scaling.
